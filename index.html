        <p>The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.

            The Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development.
            
            The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In this waterfall model, the phases do not overlap.</p>
      </div>
        
          <button class="accordion">iterative</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The iterative model is a particular implementation of a software development life cycle (SDLC) that focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, which then progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the final system is complete. When discussing the iterative method, the concept of incremental development will also often be used liberally and interchangeably, which describes the incremental alterations made during the design and implementation of each new iteration.

            Throughout this article we will take a deeper dive into the iterative model, including where it originated from, how the process is actually implemented within a project, and both the advantages and disadvantages that can arise from its use, so let’s get crackin’!</p>

          <button class="accordion">Prototyping</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The prototyping model is a systems development method in which a prototype is built, tested and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable outcome is achieved from which the complete system or product can be developed.</p>
      </div>
        
        
            <button class="accordion">Spiral</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The spiral model is a risk-driven software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.</p>
      </div>
        
              <button class="accordion">V-shape</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In software development, the V-model refers to a development process that can be considered an extension of the Kose model, and is an example of a more general V-model. Instead of moving linearly downwards, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase to form a typical V-shape.

        </p>
      </div>
              <button class="accordion">Agile</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The meaning of Agile is swift or versatile."Agile process model" refers to a software development approach based on iterative development. Agile methods break tasks into smaller iterations, or parts do not directly involve long term planning. The project scope and requirements are laid down at the beginning of the development process. Plans regarding the number of iterations, the duration and the scope of each iteration are clearly defined in advance.

            Each iteration is considered as a short time "frame" in the Agile process model, which typically lasts from one to four weeks. The division of the entire project into smaller parts helps to minimize the project risk and to reduce the overall project delivery time requirements. Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development life cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing before a working product is demonstrated to the client.</p>
